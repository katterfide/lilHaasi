# lilhaasi

simple haas delay and stereo widening plugin

---

## what this does

this plugin lets you delay either the left or right audio channel by up to 250 ms  
the result is the haas effect, which can be used for stereo widening or to create unusual stereo images

using strong haas or extreme widening sounds very unfamiliar and interesting  
i made this plugin to experiment with those effects

---

## controls

- horizontal slider  
- move left = delays left channel  
- move right = delays right channel  
- center = no delay

---

## why

i wanted an easy way to try aggressive haas and widening because the sound is unique and not very common  
this is for experimentation and creative sound design
